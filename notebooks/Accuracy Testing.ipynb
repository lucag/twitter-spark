    "Such score is, to me at least, rather suprising: it's actually slightly **better** than the ones reported as the [official results](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WV-XTvQDpuH_IfKrjzeZ361s1ykcskDNNuOV3oI39_c/edit) for the task (they range between 60.77 and 64.84). In fairness, it certainly would need to be tested on the Semeval dataset, but the evidence is that it performs well on the present one.\n",

    "The result is suprising for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the model was trained on movie reviews, but it generalizes over certain language patterns that might be common to the two domains;\n",
    "* despite there being no provision in the code for dealing with the quirkiness of Twitter texts, the score is still comparable to the output of systems specifcally tailored to the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the latter, the `CoreNLP` code uses rule-based tokenizer and lexer, which are tailored to deal with well-behaved texts the model was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying the sentiment analyzer on the command line, it's easy to grt a sense of its sensitivity to spelling mistakes, the presence of hashtgs and emoticons, and the very specific language and abbreviations that people use on Twitter. By integrating some Twitter-specific tools for parsing (like [Noah Smith's group's](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/TweetNLP/)) should help further improve the score. "
